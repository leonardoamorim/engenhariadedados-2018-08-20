    Write a Hive query for each of the tasks below. Save the queries in a single text file named Task10.hive:
        Compute the average arrdelay of flights landing in Denver (dest equals "DEN")
        Compute the average arrdelay of flights where the origin is LAX and the dest is SFO
        Determine which dest airport had the highest average arrdelay
