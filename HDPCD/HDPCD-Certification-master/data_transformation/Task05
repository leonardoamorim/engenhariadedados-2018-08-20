==Cleanse Data using Pig==

    Notice the comma-separated values of the flightdelays files in HDFS contain historical data for airline flight delays. 

    The columns in the files match the following schema:
    Year, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, DepTime, CRSDepTime, ArrTime, CRSArrTime,
    UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, ActualElapsedTime, CRSElapsedTime, AirTime,
    ArrDelay, DepDelay, Origin, Dest, Distance, TaxiIn, TaxiOut, Cancelled, 
    CancellationCode, Diverted, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay,
    LateAircraftDelay                
                    

    Write a Pig script that satisfies all of the following criteria:
    -  Load all of the data in /user/horton/flightdelays/flight*
    -  Remove all rows in the flightdelays data where the DepTime column equals the string "NA".
    -  The output should only contain the Year, Month, DayofMonth, DepTime, UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, ArrDelay, Origin and Dest
    -  Store the result as comma-separated records in a new directory in HDFS named /user/horton/flightdelays_clean
    -  Save the script in a file named Task05.pig.
